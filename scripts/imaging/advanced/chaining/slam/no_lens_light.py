"""
SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): No Lens Light
============================================

SLaM pipelines break the analysis of 'galaxy-scale' strong lenses down into multiple pipelines which focus on modeling
a specific aspect of the strong lens, first the Source, then the (lens) Light and finally the Mass. Each of these
pipelines has it own inputs which customize the model and analysis in that pipeline.

The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the model used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE PIPELINE
uses a parametric `Sersic` profile for the bulge, this will be used in the subsequent MASS TOTAL PIPELINE.

Using a SOURCE LP PIPELINE, SOURCE PIX PIPELINE and a MASS TOTAL PIPELINE this SLaM script fits `Imaging`
of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted from the data and model.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `PowerLaw`.
 - The source galaxy is reconstructed using a `DelaunayBrightnessImage` mesh and `ConstantSplit` regularization scheme.

This uses the SLaM pipelines:

 `source_lp`
 `source_pix`
 `mass_total`

__SOURCE LP PIPELINE__

The SOURCE LP PIPELINE uses one search to initialize a robust model for the source galaxy's light, which in
this example:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge for the source's light.
 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.
 
__Settings__:
 
 - Mass Centre: Fix the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the SOURCE INVERSION 
 PIPELINE).

"""
__SOURCE PIX PIPELINE__

The SOURCE PIX PIPELINE uses two searches to initialize a robust model for the `Pixelization` that
reconstructs the source galaxy's light. 

The first search, which is an initialization search, fits a `DelaunayMagnification` mesh with `Constant` 
regularization. 

The second search, which uses the mesh and regularization used throughout the remainder of the SLaM pipelines,
fits the following model:

 - Uses a `DelaunayBrightnessImage` pixelization.
 - Uses an `AdaptiveBrightness` regularization.
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE through to the
 SOURCE PIX PIPELINE.

__Settings__:

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_pixelization.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE PIX PIPELINE to initialize the model priors. 

In this example it:

 - Uses an `PowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [The centre if unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 - Uses a `Pixelization` for the source's light [fixed from SOURCE PIX PIPELINE].
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINES through to the MASS 
 PIPELINE.
 
__Settings__:

 - adapt: We may be using adapt features and therefore pass the result of the SOURCE PIX PIPELINE to use as the
 hyper dataset if required.

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_pixelization.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.
