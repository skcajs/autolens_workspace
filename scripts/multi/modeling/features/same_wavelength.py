Modeling: Mass Total + Source Parametric
========================================

This script fits a multiple `Imaging` datasets observed at the same wavelength of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a
model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted (and is not present in the simulated data).
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's light is a parametric `Sersic`.

This script demonstrates how PyAutoLens's multi-dataset modeling tools can also simultaneously analyse datasets
observed at the same wavelength.

An example use case might be analysing undithered HST images before they are combined via the multidrizzing process,
to remove correlated noise in the data.

This is an advanced script and assumes previous knowledge of the core **PyAutoLens** API for lens modeling. Thus,
certain parts of code are not documented to ensure the script is concise.

TODO: NEED TO INCLUDE DIFFERENT POINTING / CENTERINGS.

 - The summing process ensures that tasks such as outputting results to hard-disk, visualization, etc use a 
 structure that separates each analysis and therefore each dataset.
